        The NUS-Cornell Global Investor Friendliness Index (GIFI) is an annual ranking that measures the degree to which countries are investor friendly, i.e. providing ease of access for flows of international and domestic financial capital though the existence and development of relevant infrastructure, technology, regulations and policies in place to attract and retain investments and talent. These in turn also drive economic growth and prosperity of nations, and enable market players to make more informed investment decisions.

        Global financial markets continue to grow in depth and complexity against the backdrop of evolving regulatory frameworks, as well as technological advancements promoting access and participation. Whilst the universe for investment opportunities has expanded, asset owners and asset managers now face new challenges, such as optimal allocation of resources across geographies, sectors and asset classes;  identification and assessment of investment risks, domestic or foreign; regulation of financial markets to ensure stability and prevent market manipulation; as well as ever changing macro-economic and socio-political conditions. For a country, being Investor Friendly means providing ease of access for flows of international and domestic financial capital (global money or asset flows), with relevant infrastructure and policies in place to attract and retain investments and talent, both key components that drive economic growth and prosperity, and for investors to make more informed decisions. <br/><br/>

        With this in mind, CAMRI at NUS Business School and the Parker Center at Cornell University initiated research efforts into the development of an index that provides a measure of the degree of investor-friendliness of a country. Co-published in partnership with PricewaterhouseCoopers, the NUS-Cornell Global Investor Friendliness Index (‘GIFI’) aims to:
        <ul>
        <li>Assist asset managers and asset owners in global asset flows, asset allocation and investment decisions</li> 
        <li>Highlight best practices for promoting investor friendliness </li>
        <li>Serve as a benchmarking tool for asset managers, asset owners, policy makers, governments, consultants and academics seeking insight into the drivers of investor friendliness in financial markets</li>
        <li>Nudge or encourage governments and policy makers to move towards more progressive investor friendliness policies, which in turn will serve their economies well</li>
        </ul>
